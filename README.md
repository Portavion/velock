## üì¶ Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps.

### üöÄ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16.x or higher) and **npm** or **yarn**.
- **Npm**: If you prefer using npm for package management and running scripts.
- **macOS:** iOS development requires a macOS environment.
- **Xcode:** Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Xcode is Apple's
  integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS development.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools:** Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed.
  You can install these by opening Xcode and navigating to
  `Xcode > Preferences > Locations` or by running `xcode-select --install` in
  your terminal.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Portavion/Chalkr.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using Npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   The Expo CLI will automatically load environment variables with an
   EXPO*PUBLIC* prefix from .env files for use within your JavaScript code
   whenever you use the Expo CLI, such as when running npx expo start to start
   your app in local development mode.

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   The app is currently only developed and tested for iOs.

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```
